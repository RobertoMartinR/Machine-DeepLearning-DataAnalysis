In this repo I'm going to be uploading different projects/exercises I've been working on to practise and learn new concepts in the AI & Big Data Specialization Course I studied. 
Those exercises are from different areas like Machine Learning, Deep Learing, Data Cleaning, Dimensionality Reduction and everyhthing I feel like has to be here.
